# pycpu
Simple CPU simulator for educational purposes

This is a quick and dirty cpu simulator building on the breadboard cpu built by ???????? (have to look this up) on YouTube. This will emulate a 16-bit computer (more or less) with a very limited instruction set that may be expanded if needed. The current version is programmed at a very high level and may get rewriten at a much lower level in the future.
